Safe Street Project
Overview
The Safe Street Project is a technology-driven initiative aimed at enhancing urban safety by providing real-time data and insights on safe travel routes. This platform uses machine learning, geospatial data, and user inputs to predict safe streets and advise on the best paths to take, particularly in high-crime areas. The goal is to help individuals, especially commuters and travelers, navigate cities with greater confidence and security.

Key Features
Real-time Crime Data Integration: Leveraging crime statistics and real-time data to predict safer travel paths based on recent criminal activity.
Route Optimization: Uses machine learning to analyze crime data and recommend the safest routes for daily commutes, late-night travels, and emergencies.
Interactive Map Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface that visualizes safe and risky areas within the city.
User Feedback: Users can submit safety reports about incidents or hazardous locations, contributing to the real-time accuracy of the platform.
Notifications: Get alerts for updates in safety conditions, like recent crimes, road closures, or unsafe conditions in certain areas.
Technologies Used
Python: Backend development, data processing, and integration of machine learning models.
Flask: Web framework used to develop the web application and API endpoints.
Mapbox API: For geospatial mapping, location-based services, and visualization of streets.
Machine Learning (LSTM): Used to predict trends in crime patterns and route safety over time.
PostgreSQL: Database to store location data, crime statistics, and user-submitted reports.

How It Works
The Safe Street Project works by combining historical crime data with real-time inputs to help users navigate the safest paths. When you enter your starting point and destination, the system uses a combination of machine learning and geospatial mapping to calculate the safest route by analyzing factors such as:

Recent crime statistics (robbery, assault, etc.)
Time of day (crime rates vary by time)
User-reported incidents in specific areas
